## Fake News Detection using Artificial Neural Network with Pytorch

Fake News Detector is a machine learning-based application designed to identify fake news articles using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model implemented with PyTorch. Developed as a final project for the Deep Learning course, this system processes Indonesian news content and classifies it as either real or fake. The project highlights the full machine learning workflow—from data preprocessing and tokenization to model training, evaluation, and deployment via a CLI-based interface.
